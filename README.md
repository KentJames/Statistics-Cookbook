## Overview

This is a collection of jupyter notebooks describing introductory topics in statistics in data science, such as basic probability distributions, the difference between Bayesian and Frequentist statistics, and some links with optimisation of functions.

A worked example is included for locating a lighthouse in a Bayesian manner with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.

## Dependency Installs

This should run with an out of the bag Jupyter install. I personally use brew, however conda is the best way to get up and going. Dependencies are:

- numpy
- scipy

### Anaconda

By far the easiest way to get going and the _lingua franca_ of python package managers currently is conda:
